The scripts in this library are invoked by the main scripts (in the CLANFIELD folder) to consolidate the date and produce tables and charts 
to facilitate the analysis of the UFO Data

Typically, the main scripts will call these scripts several times 
  - per camera per month, 
  = per camera YTD, 
  - for all cameras YTD, 
  - and for all events captured over the lifetime of the Meteor Station
