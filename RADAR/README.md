The YTD Clanfield NEMETODE data files are forawrded to Steve Futcher each month for comparison with the RADAR records from Clanfield and Emsworth
He returns a file of probable matches which are then presented to RADAR_V5.R which uses them to extract all matching records from the Q1 UFO Orbit Output file
which must have been created previously by processing the ALLUK Analysis data through UFO Orbit to create a set of Unified Radiants.

This means that we can use the output file from RADAR_V5.R to plot the ground tracks of all meteors captured by the 
Clanfield video AND RADAR systems, and by at least one other video station.

Note. The only reason for using the NEMETODE data for this exercise is it is a more convenient format!
