## Aircraft Counts
  
I seem to have missed this chart for a few months. The reality is aircraft flybys are seasonal
with high and low contributions by jets and helecopters.


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width='100%'}

library(knitr)
File_In <<- (paste(params$Data_Folder,params$Rpt_Month," ",params$Rpt_Year,"/","Chart_Category_Bar_",params$Rpt_Year,"_YTD__Aircraft.jpg",sep=""))

knitr::include_graphics(File_In)
```
