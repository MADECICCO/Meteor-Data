Notes/Issues:
  
It's been a good year for flying insects with 6,725 recorded so far this year although in `r params$Rpt_Month` the number of insect visits dropped whilst the number of meteors observed was up substantially, so the 'gap' has narrowed.
  
2,194 additional events were recorded in `r params$Rpt_Month`.
