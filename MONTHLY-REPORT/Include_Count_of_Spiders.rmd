## Spider Counts
  
For most of this year the spiders have been left to their own devices . they have had their moments, but they either got bored or, more likely, predated by the birds. Spider repellent has been applied on a couple of occasions, but they don't seem too bothered by it! Spider numbers are now right down, although I think there is a cobweb on the SE camera which occasionally gets illuminated by stray lights.
