## Weather Counts
  
It is easy to see the major storms (with thunder and lightning) since records started in 2014. July's storm broke the record for most flashes in a single night as the storm blew up from the south and passed right over the observatory to bother both northern cameras for the rest of the night/early morning. A slight spike in the number of weather events in early November can be attributed to local fireworks displays !
