# System Lifetime Behaviour
  
The following chart shows the total counts for "Meteor" event captured by the Clanfield cameras. 
  
NB. For similar charts covering the remaining (non Meteor) categories, refer to Appendix B at the end of this report.
  
NB. Starting in the new year I will drop the first two years from this chart to aid reading the x axis labels !
  
```{r run-count-of-meteors, include=FALSE}
out = NULL
  
out = c(out, knit_child('Include_Count_of_Meteors.Rmd'))
```
`r paste(out, collapse = '\n')`
