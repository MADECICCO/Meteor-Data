Frustratingly, we captured evidence of the Fireball on 24th November on all three cameras - on two there was just a flash as something occurred outside the field of view. On the third camera, there was still no meteor, but it was clear to see a glow travelling down the left hand (western) edge of the video frame. The fireball the following morning was not captured by our cameras as they switch off at sunrise! That said, we did capture one true Fireball (a magnitude -4.1 Leonid) on the NE camera on 19th (see the Fireballs section, above)
