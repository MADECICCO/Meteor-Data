## Highlights
We saw `r MP_Count` `r MP_Shower` in `r params$Rpt_Month` (`r MP_Times` times more than any other shower during the month), although there were at least five events from a further `r Fives_Count -1` showers.
  
So, from the 2,194 video clips captured by the Clanfield cameras in `r params$Rpt_Month` `r params$Rpt_Year` , a total of 778 turned out to be usable meteors (excluding 19 on the morning of 1st November but including 22 on the morning of 1st December).
  
The following (reduced) table shows showers observed during `r params$Rpt_Month` with more than five events, sorted in descending order of frequency .
