More fireballs! on 19th at 05:47:05 William Stewart captured a nice spectrum from a mag -7.2 Leonid on his camera in Cheshire.It was also captured on multiple video and radar systems across the country. The spectrum is significant ... Bill Ward remarked "I've never seen the Ca II lines split in the first order before on a video system. It's an impressive catch."
