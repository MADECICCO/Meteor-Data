These scripts consolidate and analyse data captured by and about a (Sonotaco UFO based) video meteor capture system.

On a regular basis (ideally daily), the UFO captures are assessed and categorised remotely (for example via TeamViewer). Counts are maintained of all events to enable system admin to look for problems / areas for improvement (eg spiders that need to be evicted!). 
False clips (eg those spiders) can then be deleted to keep a lid on data volumes.

The first set of scripts chart these counts to facilitate this analysis

Valid clips (those we believe are genuine meteor events) are downloaded from the capture PC(s) regularly (typically at the end of each calendar month), and processed through UFO Analyser to determine trajectories and velocities.

The second set of scripts performs quality checks on the output from UFO Analyser and charts the results to ensure that the data is of the highest quality possible before it is integrated with data from other meteor detection stations and input into UFO Orbit for triangulation to permit determination of the orbital characteristics of the originating meteoroid.

There will be a third set of scripts that is intended to maximise the automation of the UFO Analyser process

Other scripts will be added over time, including some to merge meteor data from multiple meteor networks (initially UKMON and NEMETODE)
